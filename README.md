Modern Java EE 6 &amp; HTML 5 based issue tracker.



After a brief research, one can find out that there's no Java-based quality free opensource issue tracker (see e.g. Wiki).

The task would be to create a modern modular customizable pluginable multi-user multi-project "web 2.0" database-backed issue tracker.
Customizations would include user group hierarchy, issue states (ideally state automata with conditions to change), different party acks, versions, project components, privileges.
Plugins would allow adding custom fields and appropriate UI  bindings.
Searching would be done through Lucene over ElasticSearch or similar.
